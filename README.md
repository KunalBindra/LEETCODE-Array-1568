# LEETCODE-Array-1568
To dry run the given code, let's analyze how it would behave with an example grid. Consider the following grid as input:

```
grid = [
  [1, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1]
]
```

This grid represents a 3x3 grid with 1s indicating land and 0s indicating water.

### Step-by-Step Dry Run

1. **Initial Check (`disconnected(grid)`):**
   - The `disconnected` function is called to check if the grid is already disconnected.
   - **DFS Traversal:**
     - Starting from `grid[0][0]`, DFS visits the first island (top-left corner). It marks the land cells `(0,0)` and `(0,1)` and `(1,0)` as visited.
     - It does not find another island in this DFS run.
     - Continuing the loop, it finds a new unvisited island at `(2,2)` and increments the island count to 2.
     - Since the island count is greater than 1, `disconnected` returns `true`.
   - Since the grid is already disconnected, the `minDays` function immediately returns `0`.

So, for this grid, the function will return `0`, indicating that the grid is already disconnected without needing to remove any land.

### Dry Run with a Different Grid

Consider the grid:
```
grid = [
  [1, 1],
  [1, 1]
]
```

1. **Initial Check (`disconnected(grid)`):**
   - The `disconnected` function is called.
   - **DFS Traversal:**
     - It starts DFS from `(0,0)` and visits all the connected land cells `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, and `(1,1)`.
     - The island count is `1`, so `disconnected` returns `false`.

2. **Try Removing 1 Land:**
   - The algorithm tries removing each land cell one by one and checks if it causes disconnection.
   - For each cell:
     - It sets `grid[i][j]` to `0` and calls `disconnected(grid)`.
     - After each attempt, `disconnected(grid)` returns `true` only when `(0,1)` or `(1,0)` is removed, indicating disconnection.
     - Therefore, the function returns `1` as it only takes removing one land cell to disconnect the grid.

For this grid, the function will return `1`, indicating that removing one land cell is sufficient to disconnect the grid.

### Conclusion

The dry run demonstrates how the code works by first checking if the grid is already disconnected, then trying to remove one land cell, and if that fails, removing two land cells. The function ensures that it finds the minimum number of days (land removals) required to disconnect the grid.
